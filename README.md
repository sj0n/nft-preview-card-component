## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Cube CSS Metodology

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use SASS to improve my development experience combined with CUBE CSS methodology which helps you structure your css code. It's similar to BEM but CUBE CSS is better in my opinion because CUBE CSS force you to construct any components with only the default properties and you'll have to use a utilities class and data atributes to modify the components which helps keep the component modular.

### Useful resources

- [Card overlay with icon](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - Helps me understand how to implement color overlay with icon on a card component.
- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - Official documentation for SASS. Very easy to understand and follow along.
